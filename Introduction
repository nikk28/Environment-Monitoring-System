The advancement and innovations in technology triggers the needs for controlling and monitoring of
different environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity and CO2. The system hardware platforms are
basically low-power embedded microcontroller systems with on board sensors and analog I/O ports for
connecting the sensors.
Prediction and estimation with Arduino has two components, hardware components and software
components. Hardware component are those components that detect and organized the environment parameter
e.g. Arduino board, bread board, sensors, jumper wires, USB cable for connecting Arduino board with
computer. Then second component is Arduino software which tells what hardware component of Arduino to do.
The software has an environment in which codes are typed and edited. Initially, the hardware connection is
made and deployed, the connection in environment surfaces to detect the parameters (e.g., temperature,
humidity and CO2 and etc.) while a program codes extract and organize data from the sensors, manage it and
display variations in the environmental parameters. Sensor devices are placed at different locations to collect the
data and predict the behavior of a particular area with variations in selected environmental parameters, the
output of each sensor is then loaded and displayed in a serial monitor. The program in Arduino IDE uses
looping i.e. a particular program will keep on iterating until it has been terminated
